### 1- Array
<details> <summary>Click to expend</summary>
  
- Array is a collection of Homegenous elements, which store the data in a linear manner. Array is an type of Linear data structure.
- Basic Operations
> [Traverse](https://github.com/Dushyantsingh-ds/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/Projects/Array/Array-Traversing) − print all the array elements one by one. <br/> 
> [Insertion](https://github.com/Dushyantsingh-ds/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/Projects/Array/Array-Insertion-v1) − Adds an element at the given index. <br/>
> [Deletion](https://github.com/Dushyantsingh-ds/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/Projects/Array/Array-Deletion-v1) − Deletes an element at the given index. <br/>
> [Search](https://github.com/Dushyantsingh-ds/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/Projects/Array/Array-Search-v1) − Searches an element using the given index or by the value. <br/>
> [Update](https://github.com/Dushyantsingh-ds/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/Projects/Array/Array-Update-v1) − Updates an element at the given index. <br/>

### 1- Stack
<details> <summary>Click to expend</summary>
  
- Stack is a collection of Homegenous elements, which store the data in a tabular form. Stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) & as well an Linear data structure. 
- Basic Operations
> [Push()](https://github.com/Dushyantsingh-ds/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/Projects/Stack/Stack-Push) − Pushing (storing) an element on the stack. <br/> 
> [Pop()](https://github.com/Dushyantsingh-ds/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/Projects/Stack/Stack-Pop) − Removing (accessing) an element from the stack. <br/>
